# factorial
Explanation:
This code implements a program to find the factorial of a given number using recursion. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

The factorial function takes a parameter n and uses recursion to calculate the factorial. It checks if n is either 0 or 1, in which case it returns 1 since the factorial of 0 and 1 is defined as 1. For any other positive integer, it recursively calls itself with n - 1 as the argument and multiplies the result by n. This process continues until n becomes 0 or 1, and the recursion stops.

In the main part of the code, the user is prompted to enter a number. The input is stored in the number variable. The factorial function is then called with the number as an argument to calculate the factorial. The result is stored in the result variable. Finally, the program prints the factorial of the given number.

Please note that the code assumes the input is a non-negative integer. Additional input validation and error handling may be necessary to handle other types of inputs or handle edge cases.
